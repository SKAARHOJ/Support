# Support

This is the GitHub Repository for SKAARHOJ Support. We keep our manuals and other relevant support files in this Repository. The manual page on our website is: https://www.skaarhoj.com/support/

For UniSketch Controllers
If you are looking to access the Config Page of your UniSketch OS based device or want to alter settings such as IP address then get our Firmware Updater Application: https://www.skaarhoj.com/support/firmware-updater/. The beta version of the Firmware Updater is stored here: https://github.com/SKAARHOJ/skaarhoj-updater-releases/releases

As our controllers are generic in what they can do we donÂ´t have specific manuals for each product. We recommend starting with the "Installation and Operation Manual" and then the manuals for the relevant Device Cores. If you are utilizing Device Cores with PTZ Camera please also have a look in the "PTZ Manual".

For Blue Pill Controllers
The manual  page on our website is: https://www.skaarhoj.com/support/blue-pill-manuals
Additionally, set up information and guides can be found on our wiki page: https://wiki.skaarhoj.com/
